# Utilising Multi-view Data for Identification of Alzheimer's Diseases

**Project Duration:** April 2023 - December 2023  
**Associated Institution:** University of Greenwich  

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust system for detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or assessing its severity using MRI images (Axial). The solution leverages **multi-view data** and integrates advanced feature extraction and machine learning techniques to perform multi-class classification, accurately identifying the stages of AD in patients.

## Key Features

1. **Feature Extraction Techniques:**
   - **Region of Interest (ROI):** Extracts meaningful segments from MRI images to focus on areas indicative of AD.
   - **Histogram of Gradients (HoG):** Captures edge and texture features of MRI images to improve classification accuracy.

2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Support Vector Machine - Second Order Kernel (SVM-2k)
   - Decision Tree
   - Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) Model

3. **Classification Accuracy:**
   - Achieved **89% accuracy** in multi-class classification for identifying different levels of AD.

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - A user-friendly GUI was implemented to provide an interactive platform for users to upload MRI images and view classification results.
